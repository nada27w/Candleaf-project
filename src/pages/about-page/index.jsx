          <h2>Welcome to Candleaf</h2>
          <p>
            At Candleaf, we believe in the power of light and fragrance to
            transform spaces and uplift spirits. Our journey began with a simple
            idea: to create candles that not only illuminate but also inspire.
          </p>
          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in 2024, Candleaf was born out of a passion for
            craftsmanship and a love for nature. Our founders, Nada Wael &
            Khaled Hani envisioned a brand that combines the finest natural
            ingredients with exquisite design. From humble beginnings in a small
            workshop, we have grown into a beloved brand known for our
            commitment to quality and sustainability.
          </p>
